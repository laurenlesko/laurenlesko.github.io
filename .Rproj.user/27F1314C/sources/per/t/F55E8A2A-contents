## Cycle Study

To determine whether people who are naturally cycling experience variation in their a) energy levels and b) interest in potential partners, I am recruiting participants to take surveys for 30 nights in a row and provide saliva samples on two occasions.

## Scale Development

In order to measure libido without conflating it with finding people attractive, I am developing a new sexual desire scale.

If anti-LGBT attitudes can sometimes be a result of moral disgust, and messaging of one disgust type can influence the experience of other disgust types, can pathogen disgust priming impact anti-LGBT attitudes?
