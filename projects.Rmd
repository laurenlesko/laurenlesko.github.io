## Physical Activity Study

To determine whether people who are naturally cycling experience variation in their a) energy levels and b) interest in potential partners, I am recruiting participants to take surveys for 45 nights in a row, provide saliva samples on four occasions, and take LH tests on ten occasions.

## Scale Development

The number of people someone finds attractive might not be totally dependent on their libido, particularly for women and some sexual orientation minorities (e.g., those on the asexual spectrum). In order to measure libido without conflating it with finding people attractive, I am developing a new sexual desire scale, validating it, and distributing it cross-culturally.

## Disgust

If anti-LGBT attitudes can sometimes be a result of moral disgust, and messaging of one disgust type can influence the experience of other disgust types, can pathogen disgust priming impact anti-LGBT attitudes?
